[tools whirring]

4
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:32,479
[Narrator] In October 2018,
the anonymous street artist

5
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,241
known as Banksy published
this video online.

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,521
In it, he can be seen
preparing a custom frame

7
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:41,765
for his painting,
Girl with Balloon.

8
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:46,563
The painting is about to be
offered for sale at Sotheby's,

9
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:49,738
one of the world's most
exclusive auction houses.

10
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,466
[dramatic music]

11
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:56,987
I have $30,000 dollars.

12
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,643
Have we got 32,000?

13
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:02,027
The event was a
typical art auction.

14
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,376
Banksy's lot was the
last lot of the evening.

15
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:09,448
The piece sold for
over a million US.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,487
Last chance at 850,000 pounds.

17
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:16,628
The gavel came down,
sold, gone, sold.

18
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,182
Selling for 860,000.
[bangs gavel]

19
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:22,530
As the hammer struck,

20
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:25,325
the work started to
fall through the frame.

-[commotion]
-[beeping]

22
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,435
And as it did, it shredded.

23
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:35,578
And everybody witnessed in
horror as it was destroyed.

24
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:42,447
I was like [inaudible]

25
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:43,275
[grunts]

26
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,242
Street artist Banksy pulled off

27
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:48,521
one of the greatest pranks in
the history of the art world.

28
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:50,144
It caused a huge stir.

29
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,353
I mean, nothing like
that had ever happened.

30
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:56,287
[speaking in foreign language]

31
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,879
That stunt has already
increased the value

32
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,846
of that painting
up to $7 million.

33
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:07,022
It plays on people's
fears and emotions

34
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:08,852
and what true value is.

35
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,199
Where do we place
value in society?

36
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:13,133
Who does art belong to?

37
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:15,927
He created an art history moment

38
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:18,413
and wrote himself again
into the history books.

39
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,002
[rock music]

40
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,850
[curious music]

41
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,615
[Narrator] The stunt atSotheby's wasn't the first time

42
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,514
that Banksy had ambushed
one of the august

43
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,171
institutions of the art world.

44
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:57,176
15 years earlier, in
the winter of 2003,

45
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,593
a mysterious figure
entered Tate Britain,

46
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,284
one of the UK's most
prestigious art museums

47
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,149
and placed a
painting on the wall.

48
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,085
Over the following 18 months,
fake exhibits appeared

49
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:12,743
in London's Natural History
Museum, the Louvre in Paris,

50
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:15,849
and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York,

51
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:19,612
all covertly installed by
the same anonymous stranger.

52
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:25,274
He went through seven
different galleries,

53
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:30,037
putting seven different works
of art up in these galleries.

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,487
The one in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art

55
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:34,903
only lasted two hours,
which was understandable,

56
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,804
because it was a painting of
a rather posh-looking lady.

57
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:42,980
She had a gas mask on, and
that was spotted very quickly.

58
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,362
But the one in
the Museum of Art,

59
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,260
that lasted for several days,

60
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:51,747
because it was a painting
of a Tesco can of soup,

61
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:54,543
and it looked just like
the Warhol cans of soup,

62
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,270
and no one noticed it.

63
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:58,271
It was a daring thing to do.

64
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,240
He did it, he got away with it,

65
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,241
and everyone suddenly
knew his name.

66
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,211
[Narrator] But a name
was all the public had.

67
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,388
Everything else
remained a mystery.

68
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,907
Who was the secretive
artist that had evaded

69
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,013
some of the world's
tightest security

70
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,843
to hang his own work
alongside that of Monet,

71
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:19,396
Picasso, and Warhol?

72
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,917
Was he just one person?

73
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,161
Or was Banksy a group of people?

74
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:28,889
Was he hiding his identity
because he was already famous,

75
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:32,754
someone known to the public,
perhaps a musician or actor?

76
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,000
The stunts themselves
contained clues.

77
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:41,694
Banksy had launched anaudacious game of cat and mouse.

78
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,697
At the Tate, he
had risked arrest

79
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:46,286
to bring his art to the public.

80
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:51,324
In the Met, his piece had been
quickly removed by curators

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,533
who were sure that it
didn't belong in a gallery.

82
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:57,951
And at Sotheby's, Banksy had
performed an act of vandalism.

83
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,646
And it was with vandalism
that it had all started.

84
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,442
[loud banging]

85
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:08,168
[energetic hip hop music]

86
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,011
[Voice Actor] Graffiti hasbeen used to start revolutions,

87
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:24,324
start wars, and
generally is the voice

88
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,774
of the people who
aren't listened to.

89
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,120
Graffiti is one of
the few tools you have

90
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,812
if you have almost nothing.

91
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,641
And even if you don't
come up with a picture

92
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,886
to cure world
poverty, you can make

93
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,990
someone smile when
they're having a piss.

94
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,617
Graffiti isn't an art form.

95
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:45,103
Graffiti is a reaction,

96
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:47,449
an impulse,

97
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,658
is like a spark.

98
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:54,319
Dynamic, explosive,
unpredictable.

99
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,355
Some people say
graffiti ruined my life

100
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,634
and some people say
graffiti saved my life.

101
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:00,843
A rush.

102
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:02,776
It's an addiction.

103
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,055
The rush, I think, is sort
of a consequence of it all.

104
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,161
You're scared, and
your blood is pumping,

105
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:11,785
and your adrenaline is pumping.

106
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,338
But really you're doing
it for the recognition

107
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
and not the rush.

108
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:20,310
Running round a city
and getting your name up

109
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:22,242
in as many places
as you possible can.

110
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,452
The more risky, the better.

111
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:30,182
You want your name as big
as possible in lights.

112
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,944
It's fucking ridiculous,
but. [chuckles]

113
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:42,608
Graffiti is always the
heartbeat of society.

114
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:48,338
It captures what's going on
at that time, in that moment.

115
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:51,134
For every Banksy that's
on top and is visible,

116
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:54,723
you've got hundreds that may
be underground and invisible.

117
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,519
[train clacking]

118
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,634
[upbeat hip hop music]

119
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:28,377
Graffiti emerged in Philadelphia

120
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:32,521
and then New York in the
late '60s and early '70s.

121
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:35,144
The city was in
quote/unquote crisis.

122
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:40,701
It was a city that
didn't have much revenue.

123
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,047
There was a lot of crime,

124
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,877
there was a lot of
drugs, a lot of poverty.

125
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:47,605
Graffiti writing
started in neighborhoods

126
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,781
like the Upper West Side
of Manhattan, the Bronx,

127
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:54,058
Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn,
and it was a movement

128
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:57,752
started by young kids that
were writing their names

129
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:00,721
with their street numbers
on the walls around town

130
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:04,413
to get recognized in some way.

131
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,278
Sort of a game of tag.

132
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:09,040
You're actually putting
your name on a place

133
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,627
and sort of putting it
more and more and more

134
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,112
and exposing yourself more,

135
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,423
and then someone
else is coming in,

136
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,528
following you and
doing the same thing.

137
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:19,394
The game exploded
when kids decided

138
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:21,983
to leave their streets
and go to the next street

139
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,502
and the next street
and the next street

140
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,952
and the next neighborhood and
the neighborhood after that.

141
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:28,956
And it became hugely popular.

142
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,581
The taller and wider
people sprayed their names,

143
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,202
then somebody came up
with the bright idea

144
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:38,172
of putting a second
color round their name.

145
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:40,796
And before you know
it, the stick letters

146
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,282
of small names on
the back of bus seats

147
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,561
had turned into
seven-foot-high letters

148
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:48,907
on the side of subway trains.

149
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:54,049
And so then it really exploded
and became an art movement.

150
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,673
[upbeat hip hop music]

151
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:10,239
[Narrator] Painting, or bombing,New York's subways system

152
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:13,759
soon became the primary focus
for young graffiti writers

153
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:17,142
obsessed with having their nameseen as widely as possible.

154
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,456
The nascent art movement
developed its own grammar,

155
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,838
rules, and culture,
all based around

156
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:26,911
rendering letter
forms, from the tag,

157
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:30,604
a signature scrawled quicklywith a spray can or marker pen,

158
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,331
all the way up to the
piece, a large-scale,

159
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,712
stylized depiction
of the artist's name.

160
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:41,615
In 1983, the public was
given its first glimpse

161
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,653
inside the graffiti
underground, with Tony Silver

162
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,793
and Henry Chalfant's
landmark film "Style Wars".

163
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:51,625
For many, Style Wars
depicted a strange, criminal,

164
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,592
and dangerous subculture.

165
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,836
But for others, it proved
to be an inspiration.
